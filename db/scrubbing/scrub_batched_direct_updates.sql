/*
 * BATCH EMAIL SCRUBBING PROCEDURE
 * ==============================
 * 
 * This procedure performs email anonymization in batches to handle large datasets
 * efficiently while avoiding timeout and memory issues.
 *
 * PROCEDURE SIGNATURE:
 *   SCRUB_BATCHES() â†’ void
 *
 * ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
 * 1. Determines the range of user IDs to process
 * 2. Processes users in batches of 1000
 * 3. Commits after each batch to prevent transaction bloat
 * 4. Provides progress feedback via RAISE NOTICE
 *
 * KEY FEATURES:
 * 1. Memory efficient (processes fixed-size batches)
 * 2. Transaction safe (commits per batch)
 * 3. Progress monitoring
 * 4. Resumable (can be restarted if interrupted)

/*
 * USAGE NOTES:
 * - Processes approximately 1000 records per transaction
 * - Progress can be monitored in the database logs
 * - Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)
 * - Can be interrupted and resumed without data loss
 *
 * EXAMPLE USAGE:
 *   CALL SCRUB_BATCHES();
